// Applications of circular linked lists:
//     Multiplayer games use this to give each player a chance to play.
//     A circular linked list can be used to organize multiple running applications on an operating system. 
//     These applications are iterated over by the OS.

// Why circular linked list?
//     A node always points to another node, so NULL assignment is not necessary.
//     Any node can be set as the starting point.
//     Nodes are traversed quickly from the first to the last.
